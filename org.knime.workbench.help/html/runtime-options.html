  <h1>The KNIME runtime options</h1>
  <p>
    KNIME's runtime behavior can be configured in various ways by passing
    options on the command line during startup. Since KNIME is based on Eclipse,
    all <a
      href="http://help.eclipse.org/indigo/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/misc/runtime-options.html">
      Eclipse</a> runtime options also apply to KNIME. KNIME also adds additional
    options, which are described below
  </p>


  <h2>
    <a name="commandline"></a>Command line arguments
  </h2>
  <p>
    Listed below are the command line arguments processed by KNIME. They can
    either be specified permanently in the
    <tt>knime.ini</tt>
    in the root of the KNIME installation, or be passed to the knime executable.
    Please note that command line arguments must be specified <em>before</em> the
    <a href="#sysprops">system properties</a> (see below) i.e. before the
    <tt>-vmargs</tt>
    parameter.<br /> Note that headless KNIME applications, such as the batch
    executor, offer quite a few command line arguments. They are not described
    here but are printed if you call the application without any arguments.
  </p>


  <dl>
    <dt>-checkForUpdates</dt>
    <dd>If this arguments is used, KNIME automatically checks for updates
      during startup. If new versions of installed features are found, the user
      will be prompted to install them. A restart is required after updates have
      been installed.</dd>
  </dl>


  <h2>
    <a name="sysprops">Java system properties</a>
  </h2>
  <p>
    Listed below are the Java system properties with which KNIME's behavior can
    be changed. They can either be specified permanently in the
    <tt>knime.ini</tt>
    in the root of the KNIME installation, or be passed to the knime executable.
    Please note that system properties must be specified <em>after</em> the
    <tt>-vmargs</tt>
    parameter. The required format is
    <code>-DpropName=propValue</code>
    .
  </p>
  <h3>General properties</h3>
  <dl>

    <dt>
      org.knime.core.maxThreads=<em>&lt;number&gt;</em>
    </dt>
    <dd>Sets the maximum number of threads that KNIME is using for
      executing nodes. By default this number is 1.5 times the number of cores.
      This property overrides the value from the KNIME preference page.</dd>

    <dt>
      knime.tmpdir=<em>&lt;directory&gt;</em>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      Sets the default directory for temporary files KNIME files (such as data
      files). This property overrides the value from the preference pages and is
      by default the same as the
      <tt>java.io.tmpdir</tt>
      .
    </dd>

    <dt>
      knime.synchronous.io=<em>(true|false)</em>
    </dt>
    <dd>
	  Can be used to enforce the sequential processing of rows for KNIME tables.
	  By default, each table container processes its rows asynchronously in a number of (potentially re-used) threads.
	  The default value is <tt>false</tt>.
	  Setting this field to <tt>true</tt> will instruct KNIME to always handle rows sequentially and synchronously, which in some cases may be slower.
    </dd>

    <dt>
      knime.async.io.cachesize=<em>&lt;number&gt;</em>
    </dt>
    <dd>
	  Sets the batch size for non-sequential and asynchronous handling of rows (see knime.synchronous.io).
	  It specifies the amount of data rows that are handled by a single container thread.
	  The larger the buffer, the smaller the synchronization overhead but the larger the memory requirements.
      This property has no effect if rows are handled sequentially.
      The default value is 10.
    </dd>

    <dt>knime.domain.valuecount=<em>&lt;number&gt;</em></dt>
    <dd>The number of nominal values kept in the domain when adding rows to a table. This is only the default and may
    be overruled by individual node implementations.</dd>


    <dt>org.knime.container.cellsinmemory=<em>&lt;number&gt;</em></dt>
    <dd>Sets the maximum number of cells per output table that are kept in memory if the the caching mode is
    "Keep only small tables in memory".
    </dd>
    
    <dt>org.knime.container.threads.total=<em>&lt;number&gt;</em></dt>
    <dd>
	  Sets the maximum number of threads that can be used to write KNIME native output tables. By default this
	  number equals the number of processors available to the JVM. <i>Note:</i> This value has to be greater than 0.
    </dd>

    <dt>org.knime.container.threads.instance=<em>&lt;number&gt;</em></dt>
    <dd>
	  Sets the maximum number of threads that can be used to write a <i>single</i> KNIME native output table. By
	  default this number equals the number of processors available to the JVM. <i>Note:</i> This value  has to
	  be greater than 0 and cannot be larger than <tt>org.knime.container.threads.total</tt>.
    </dd>

    
    <dt>
      knime.table.cache=<em>(LRU|SMALL)</em>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      The strategy for keeping tables in memory and writing tables to disk. Current
      options are <tt>LRU</tt> and <tt>SMALL</tt>. If <tt>LRU</tt> is selected, tables of any size will be cached and
      dropped from the cache only if (a) they have not been used recently or (b) memory becomes scarce. Flushing to
      disk then happens as specified in <tt>knime.synchronous.io</tt>. If <tt>SMALL</tt> is selected,
      tables are cached as in earlier versions of KNIME (&lt;v4.0). Specifically, only "small" tables (i.e., tables
      with a maximum of <tt>org.knime.container.cellsinmemory</tt> cells) are kept in memory, unless the node
      generating the table was specifically configured to flush tables to disk or keep tables in memory. Flushing of
      tables to disk then happens synchronously. The default is <tt>LRU</tt>.
    </dd>
    
    <dt>
      knime.discourage.gc=<em>(true|false)</em>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      If set to true, discourages KNIME from triggering a full stop-the-world garbage collection.
      Note that
        (a) individual nodes are allowed to disregard this setting and
        (b) the garbage collector may independently decide that a full stop-the-world garbage collection is warranted.
    </dd>
    
    <dt>org.knime.container.minspace.temp=<em>&lt;number&gt;</em></dt>
    <dd>Java property to specify the minimum free disc space in MB that needs to be available. If less is
     available, no further table files & blobs will be created (resulting in an exception).</dd>
     
    <dt>
      knime.compress.io=<em>(GZIP|SNAPPY|UNCOMPRESSED)</em>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      Enables/disables table stream compression. Compression results in smaller
      temp-file sizes but also (sometimes significant) longer runtime. The
      default is <tt>SNAPPY</tt>.
    </dd>

    <dt>
      knime.disable.rowid.duplicatecheck=<em>(true|false)</em>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      Enables/disables row ID duplicate checks on tables. Tables in KNIME are
      supposed to have unique IDs, whereby the uniqueness is asserted using a
      duplicate checker. This property will disable this check. <br /> <strong>Warning:</strong>
      This property should not be changed by the user.
    </dd>

    <dt>
      knime.domain.valuecount=<em>&lt;number&gt;</em>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      The number of nominal values kept in the domain when adding rows to a table. This is only the default and
      may be overruled by individual node implementations. If no value is specified a default of 60 will be used.
    </dd>

    <dt>
      knime.disable.vmfilelock=<em>(true|false)</em>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      Enables/disables workflow locks. As of KNIME 2.4 workflows will be locked
      when opened; this property will disable the locking (allowing multiple
      instances to have the same workflow open). <br /> <strong>Warning:</strong>
      This property should not be changed by the user.
    </dd>

    <dt>
      knime.database.timeout=<em>&lt;number&gt;</em>
    </dt>
    <dd>Sets the timeout in seconds trying to establish a connection to a
      database. The default value is 15 seconds.</dd>

    <dt>
      knime.database.fetchsize=<em>&lt;number&gt;</em>
    </dt>
    <dd>Sets the fetch size for retrieving data from a database. The
      default value depends on the used JDBC driver.</dd>
      
    <dt>
      knime.database.batch_write_size=<em>&lt;number&gt;</em>
    </dt>
    <dd>Sets the batch write size for writing data rows into a database. The
      default value is 1, that is one row at a time.</dd>
      
    <dt>
      knime.database.enable.concurrency=<em>&lt;boolean&gt;</em>
    </dt>
    <dd> Used to switch on/off the database connection access (applies only for the same database connection). Default 
      is true, that is all database accesses are synchronized based on single connection; false means off, that is, the 
      access is not synchronized and may lead to database errors.</dd>
 
    <dt>
      knime.logfile.maxsize=<em>&lt;number&gt;</em>[mk]
    </dt>
    <dd>Allows one to change the maximum log file size (default is 10 MB).
      Values must be integer, possibly succeeded by "m" or "k" to denote that
      the given value is in mega or kilo byte.</dd>

    <dt>
      knime.repository.non-instant-search=<em>(true|false)</em>
    </dt>
    <dd>Allows to disable the live update in the node repository search.</dd>
    <dt>
      knime.macosx.dialogworkaround=<em>(true|false)</em>
    </dt>
    <dd>Allows to disable the workaround for freezes when opening node dialogs under MacOSX.</dd>
    <dt>knime.data.bitvector.maxDisplayBits=<em>&lt;number&gt;</em></dt>
    <dd>Sets the maximum number of bits that are display in string representations of bit vectors.</dd>
    
    <dt>knime.xml.disable_external_entities=<em>(true|false)</em></dt>
    <dd>If set to true, all nodes that parse XML files will not read external entities defined via a DTD. This is
    usually only useful when running as an executor on the server and you want prevent XXE attacks.</dd>
